                        <p class="card-text">Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar
                            North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto
                            series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set
                            within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player
                            story follows three protagonistsâ€”retired bank robber Michael De Santa (Ned Luke), street
                            gangster Franklin Clinton (Shawn Fonteno), and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips
                            (Steven Ogg), and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt
                            government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's open world
                            countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles. The game world is
                            navigated on foot and by vehicle, from either a third-person or first-person perspective.
                            Players control the protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during
                            and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve
                            shooting and driving gameplay. A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement
                            response to players who commit crimes. In Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online
                            multiplayer mode, up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and
                            competitive game modes. Shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide, the game's
                            development began around the time of Grand Theft Auto IV's release. The developers drew
                            influence from many of their previous projects (such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3)
                            and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of
                            its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and
                            several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the
                            design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of
                            producers who collaborated over several years. Grand Theft Auto V was released in September
                            2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox
                            One, in April 2015 for Windows, and in March 2022 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
                            Extensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and
                            became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its
                            first day and $1 billion in its first three days. It received critical acclaim, with praise
                            directed at its multiple-protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. However,
                            its depiction of violence and women caused controversies. Several gaming publications
                            awarded the game year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards. In retrospect, it is
                            considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and
                            among the best video games ever made. It is the second-best-selling video game of all time
                            with 205 million copies shipped, and one of the most financially successful entertainment
                            products of all time, with over $8.5 billion in worldwide revenue. Its successor, Grand
                            Theft Auto VI, is scheduled to be released in 2025.</p>
